Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows for multiple people to collaborate on a codebase/project at the same time. It is a version control system
that keeps track of changes in our code over time. This makes it easy to revert to previous versions of the codebase. In 
addition, people can collaborate without overwriting other people's work.
