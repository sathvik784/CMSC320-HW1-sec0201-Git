Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows for multiple people to collaborate on a codebase/project at the same time. It is a version control system
that keeps track of changes in our code over time. This makes it easy to revert to previous versions of the codebase. In 
addition, people can collaborate without overwriting other people's work.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the sports industry. For example, teams/organizations can use data science to analyze
player statistics, and make decisions to benefit the overall team performance.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging and Rebasing both combine the changes of one branch to another, but merging does so by combining the branch 
history of both branches. The existing branches are not altered in any way. However, with rebasing, moves all of the commits on
top of the other branch, effectively rewriting the projects history.
